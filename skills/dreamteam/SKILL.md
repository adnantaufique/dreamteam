name: dreamteam
description: Use when a multi-step task or an approved plan should be driven to a verified, independently-reviewed result by orchestrating specialist agents across domains (software builds, ML/CV research, devops, QA) — when one task needs several specialists, when you want review gates between steps instead of one unreviewed dump, or when you have a plan to execute with quality checkpoints.

# Dreamteam

## Overview

Orchestrate a task (or an approved plan) to a *verified* result. A **Caster** selects a dreamteam of specialist agents for the task; each unit of work runs **produce → gate (independent review) → fix → integrate**. The main loop stays the visible conductor — every gate verdict is reported. Domain-agnostic: the loop is constant, only the dreamteam changes.

For **builds**, dreamteam is spec-driven by default — the wrapper turns a raw idea into a reviewed plan, and each workstream is dispatched with a verifiable success criterion the gate then enforces. Non-build sweeps (audit, qa) skip the spec. The constant is verification, not the spec.

**Standing principles** (native to dreamteam — they hold on every run): (1) **honest** — the gate backs every claim with evidence and the Reality Checker is always on the panel; (2) **minimal-code** — producers ship the *simplest solution that fully works* (no over-engineering or speculative generality), kept complete and correct, and **never** by cutting validation, security, or accessibility; for code producers this is composed-enforced by `ponytail` + `karpathy-guidelines` when installed (see Composes); (3) **objective** — every assessment states the unvarnished verdict: no sugar-coating, no over-praise, no softening a failure toward a pass. This governs the *tone* of an assessment (don't glaze), and is distinct from (1)'s *evidence* requirement (don't claim without proof).

Runs on Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, CodeWhale, and OpenCode — tool names, subagent dispatch, and model tiers resolve per `references/platforms.md` (`--platform` defaults to auto-detect).

**Opt-in:** this runs multi-agent orchestration only when explicitly invoked (`/dreamteam …`).

## You are the conductor
**You are the conductor — you do NOT produce workstreams yourself.** Every workstream's artifact is produced by a **dispatched producer subagent**. You may ONLY: resolve the crew, **dispatch** producers/reviewers, synthesize gate findings, **integrate** a *verified* result (merge/commit/land), and report. You may read files for orchestration. You may **NOT** write code, edit files, or run builds/experiments to *produce* a workstream's artifact — that is the producer's job, and doing it yourself skips the independent gate. **When you synthesize and report, do so objectively — no glazing:** state each gate verdict plainly and never soften a fix-then-pass or needs-work into something rosier than the evidence supports (the standing **objective** principle, applied to your own synthesis).

| Conductor MAY | Conductor MUST NOT |
|---|---|
| read files/plan for orchestration; dispatch producers + reviewers; synthesize gate findings; run the capped fix loop (by re-dispatching); integrate a *verified* branch/commit; report verdicts | write/edit code or docs **to produce** a workstream's artifact; run builds/experiments **to produce** a workstream's artifact; "quick-fix" a gate finding itself instead of re-dispatching the producer |

### Red flags — STOP and dispatch
If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP — you are about to drift inline:

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This workstream is trivial / a one-liner — I'll just do it inline." | Trivial work still needs the independent gate. Dispatch it. (Observed verbatim drift: *"it's a one-liner … not worth dispatching for … small/simple/quick enough to just handle directly."*) |
| "Dispatching is overhead; faster to edit directly." | The cost is the point — independent production + review is what 'verified' means. |
| "I already know the fix." | Then the producer will too — and the gate confirms it. You knowing ≠ verified. |
| "The subagent would just do what I'd do." | The gate reviews the *producer's* output independently; you reviewing your own work isn't a gate. |
| "I'm mid-run, easier to keep going inline." | Mid-run is exactly when the directive decays — re-anchor and dispatch. |
| "I'll just fire this Agent call foreground/inline real quick." | Foreground-inline dispatch is the inline drift this rule forbids — it blocks the chat and skips background orchestration. Dispatch in the **background** (per loop.md). |
| "It's tiny / non-workstream, so the stickiness carve-out lets me inline it." | Only if it passes ALL carve-out bounds AND isn't a workstream; in doubt → dispatch. Not a reopening of "it's a one-liner." |
| "Dispatch isn't available here, so I'll just produce it myself." | **Say so and pause → escalate to the human** — surface that orchestration is unavailable; do NOT silently substitute self-authored, un-gated work for an orchestrated result. |

**Editing a file to produce a workstream — *or* dispatching producers foreground/inline in the main chat — violates the letter AND the spirit of dreamteam. STOP and dispatch in the background.**

## Session stickiness
**Once `/dreamteam` is invoked in a session, every subsequent task that produces/changes an artifact runs through dreamteam** — this extends "don't drift inline *mid-run*" to "stay in dreamteam-mode *all session*." Don't silently revert to inline on the next task.

**Session-scoped + best-effort:** the mode holds for the rest of the SESSION (across runs), tracked as conversation state — the skill is stateless, so there is no persisted store. *Best-effort:* if the decision/opt-out has fallen out of context, RE-state or RE-ask rather than assume; it is not a hard guarantee over a very long session.

**Scope:** governs tasks that **produce/change an artifact** (code/files/builds/experiments/audit deliverables). Pure Q&A, explanations, code-reading, design discussion → **answer directly** (no artifact → no workstream → nothing to gate). In a mixed "explain then change" ask, only the change is in scope.

**Opt-out (per-session, user-explicit):** "don't use dreamteam for this / do this one directly" → run ONE task outside dreamteam, then stickiness resumes; "stop using dreamteam this session" → off for the rest of the session, and a later `/dreamteam` re-arms it. **Only an explicit user statement opts out** — a task *looking* small is never opt-out (that's the carve-out). Ambiguous "skip dreamteam" → default to the narrower per-task scope.

**Carve-out — genuinely tiny, non-workstream edits:** a *direct user ask* that is NOT a workstream MAY be done inline **only if ALL hold**: not part of the current/last plan or build; **≲5 lines in one existing file**; no new logic/control-flow/files/dependencies/interface changes; nothing touching validation, security, or accessibility (examples: typo, copy/string tweak, version/constant bump, comment). **Any condition in doubt → it's not tiny → dispatch.** **State the carve-out classification visibly** before acting (auditable, not silent). This is a **narrow exception that weakens the otherwise-absolute "dispatch trivial work too" rule** — once an edit is part of a plan/build, or you'd invoke dreamteam for it, it's a workstream and the §"You are the conductor" **red flags govern, not this carve-out**.

## When to use
- A task needs more than one specialist (e.g. design + build + review).
- You want independent quality gates between steps, not one big unreviewed result.
- You have an approved plan to execute with checkpoints.
- Across domains: app builds, ML/CV research salvage, infra changes, QA sweeps.

**Not for:** a single-step task one agent handles; trivial edits; work the user hasn't asked to orchestrate.

## Invocation
```
/dreamteam <task | plan-ref>
      [--profile mobile-dev|web|ai-research|devops|qa|generic|audit|ml-dev|debug|ux-designer|tutor]
      [--depth shallow|module|exhaustive] [--mode bugs|map] [--graph on|off|auto]
      [--roster planner=…,producers=…,reviewers=…]
      [--skills a,b] [--autonomy auto|confirm|step]
      [--models planner=…,producers=<role>:<tier>;…,reviewers=<tier>] [--cost cheap|balanced|quality]
      [--platform claude|codex|gemini|codewhale|opencode] [--execution background|workflow] [--repo <path>] [--branch <name>] [--parallel]
      [--retro on|off] [--learnings <path>] [--evolve [generations=N]]
```

**Flags:** `--models` sets model tiers per role; `--cost` biases the rubric (default balanced). Tiers are abstract — `cheap|standard|capable|max` — resolved to a concrete model per platform (Claude: haiku|sonnet|opus|fable) via `references/platforms.md`. `--retro` (default on) runs the end-of-run retro (`references/retro.md`); `--learnings` overrides the store path; `--evolve` opts into Layer-B benchmark evolution (`references/evolve.md`; ai-research; requires an evaluator + ground truth; budget-printed; human-gated). `--depth`/`--mode` apply to the `audit` profile (`references/audit.md`): `--mode` defaults `bugs` (read-only bug-finding) vs `map` (project map); `--depth` is `shallow|module|exhaustive`, where `exhaustive` is budget-printed + confirm-gated. `--execution background|workflow` pre-sets the per-session execution mode (skipping the one-time prompt; see `references/loop.md`) — `workflow` is Claude-Code-only and on other CLIs falls back to background subagents (`references/platforms.md`). `--graph on|off|auto` (default `auto`) toggles the optional AST code-graph (`graphify`) the conductor keeps as navigation infra: `auto` builds/reuses it when `graphify` is installed and the repo isn't oversized — else skips silently; `off` disables it; `on` requests it (still skip-if-absent, never auto-installed). The graph is **conductor infra — never a gated workstream and never a verdict**; any graph-derived claim that would gate a workstream is verified against live code/tests (`references/loop.md` §Graph, `references/audit.md`). Recommendations are advisory + default-on (surfaced only on a real capability gap); installing one is opt-in + human-gated (reuses `--autonomy`; `auto` never auto-installs).

## The spine
1. **Resolve the dreamteam.** REQUIRED: follow `references/caster.md` (explicit `--roster/--profile/--skills` → use as-is; else profile match; else dispatch a Caster agent). Print the dreamteam + one line of rationale per pick — including each role's model tier (cheapest-that-fits per `references/caster.md`), printed next to each pick — show the abstract tier and the resolved concrete model for the active platform (e.g. standard → sonnet).
2. **Pick the entry.** A plan-ref (a path to / inline copy of an already-reviewed step-by-step plan) → the core loop. A raw idea (anything else) → run the full-lifecycle wrapper first (REQUIRED: `references/wrapper.md`). **`--profile audit` / `--profile debug` (or an audit-/debug-intent task) → skip the wrapper + plan-writing:** `audit` goes straight to the audit fan-out (`references/audit.md`) — no idea to brainstorm, no plan to write; `debug` goes **reproduce-first** straight to its investigate→fix loop — the failure *is* the spec, so there is nothing to brainstorm or plan (the gate enforces reproduce-then-resolve, `references/gate.md`). Both still run the produce→gate→fix→integrate loop (`audit`'s `integrate` is a no-op, `debug`'s lands the fix); only the wrapper + plan-writing are skipped.
3. **Run the core loop** over each workstream. **For EVERY workstream → dispatch a producer; there is no inline path.** REQUIRED: `references/loop.md`, gating each via `references/gate.md`.
4. **Report** each workstream's gate verdict; pause only for genuine decisions/blockers. Then run the retro (if `--retro` on, the default) and surface learnings + any proposed skill deltas (`references/retro.md`).

## Autonomy
- **auto** (default): propose the dreamteam → proceed; report at each gate; pause only for real decisions.
- **confirm**: confirm the dreamteam, and each gate verdict, before continuing.
- **step**: pause after every workstream.

## Resilience
- Agent unavailable → the Caster picks an alternate or flags it.
- The gate's fix loop is capped (`gate_policy.max_fix_iterations`); on exhaustion, escalate to the human — never weaken the bar to force a pass.
- Be scope/budget aware — orchestration spawns many agents; don't run away.

## Composes (do not reinvent)
REQUIRED SUB-SKILLS: `superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:writing-plans`, `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`, `superpowers:verification-before-completion`, `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`, `find-skills`.
OPTIONAL: `ponytail` — the external **enforcer** of dreamteam's native minimal-code principle (see Overview); when installed, the Caster attaches it to code-producing producers. The principle holds without it (the gate always checks over-engineering) — ponytail just enforces it harder. Cross-platform, like dreamteam.
OPTIONAL: `karpathy-guidelines` — a second composed principle-enforcer for **code-producing** producers (surface assumptions, surgical/minimal-diff changes, verifiable success criteria); like `ponytail`, the Caster attaches it to code producers when installed (`find-skills`-gated, degrades gracefully if absent). Its guidelines already ride in `loop.md`/`gate.md` — composing the skill just makes producers carry them explicitly.
OPTIONAL (highlighted): `superpowers:systematic-debugging` — the structured root-cause method dreamteam **reaches for on debug tasks and composes in the `debug` profile** (decision #7): attached to the investigator's `skills[]` when installed (`find-skills`-gated, degrades gracefully — `root-cause-analyst` investigates natively if absent). Pairs with the gate's **reproduce-then-resolve** check (`gate.md` §3).
OPTIONAL: `ui-ux-pro-max` — the **depended** design skill the `ux-designer` profile composes onto `UI Designer` when installed (`find-skills`-gated, degrades gracefully — UI Designer designs natively if absent, and a11y stays **non-waivable** either way). Not vendored; install via `references/recommend.md`.
OPTIONAL: `graphify` — an external **AST code-graph** tool the conductor keeps as **navigation infra** (codebase understanding for the `audit` profile + dev producers/Code Reviewer), gated by `--graph on|off|auto` (default `auto`). AST-only and free to refresh; **skip-if-absent, never auto-installed** (recommend-only via `references/recommend.md`), `find-skills`/tool-gated, degrades gracefully. It is **never a workstream and never decides a verdict** — graph-derived claims that would gate a workstream are verified against live code/tests (`references/loop.md` G0/G1 + §Graph invariant, `references/audit.md`). Cross-platform via its CLI / MCP server / git-hook (`references/platforms.md`).
OPTIONAL: `references/recommend.md` — when the best-fit skill isn't installed, the Caster surfaces an advisory recommendation (skills.sh + awesome-claude-code); an opt-in gated `setup` role can install an approved one. Skills-only; the Caster never installs.
OPTIONAL: `references/audit.md` — the `audit` profile: read-only bug-finding / project-map sweeps that reuse the same loop + gate (no spec, no integrate). `--depth`/`--mode` tune it.
